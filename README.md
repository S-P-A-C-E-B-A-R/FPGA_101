# FPGA 101
This repository contains FPGA projects I develop during my introduction to Digital Logic. In the interest of enhancing my collaborative skills, the projects are publicly shared under GNU GPL 3.0. Notes and documentation I develop during the project will be shared as well for process continuity.

## Preface
My personal experience with embedded systems is limited to Arduino, ESP32, and Texas Instruments CC26X2R1 and MSP430 series embedded processors. I have developed solutions using RS-232, Bluetooth, and WiFi featuring digital signal processing, various sensors, various display types, and mechanical transducers such as motors, servos, and solenoids. 

As I continue to develop projects of increasing complexity, I have discovered limitations of processor controlled systems.  I believe that developing a fundamental skillset with FPGA devices and developing skills to interface FPGA devices with microcontrollers will enhance the reliability, performance, and efficiency of complex projects.

# Introduction

As a Tufts Alumni, I immediately sought out the [ES4 online course material](http://www.ece.tufts.edu/es/4/) as a starting point for my learning journey. This semester long (14-week) course covers the theory of digital logic, state machines, and much more with practical lab based assignments. This journey shall be recorded within the "Tufts_ES4" directory.
